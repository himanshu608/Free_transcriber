## Inspiration

 - You find yourself with audio or video from work, school, a seminar, or a meeting, but you do not have time to type up the notes yourself. You may be wondering what are your options. That is where a transcription service comes in. If you do a Google search, however, you may find yourself a little overwhelmed with all the different companies and prices. We have built a platform to overcome this situation. We present you a user friendly and free of cost audio/video transcription services.

## What it does
 - Our project consists of three services :-
   -   We provide a Discord bot, which provides a speech to text service whenever a user uploads audio file on the server.
   -   We provide a fully automated AI powered chat-bot. User can interact with it by simple texting method and by voice commands. It listens to user in real time and replies accordingly.
   -   We provide a free video transcription service where user can upload a video and get the transcribed messages. User can also copy and download the messages in text and JSON formats.

## How we built it
 - We have used modern tech-stack for this project.
   - For frontend:
      - ReactJS
      - Material UI
      - Bootstrap
   - For backend
      - NodeJS
      - Symbl.ai API
      - Brainshop.ai API
      - DiscordJS

## What's next for Free-transcriber
- We plan on adding more features to the Bot like creating tickets for each transcription.
- We aim to integrate text to speech services on discord bot.

## Mentions
- What is Symbl.ai?
    - Symbl.ai is a conversation intelligence platform powered by AI. Conversation intelligence is a set of techniques to mine the actionable and useful information from conversations using AI, such as calls to action, questions asked, sentiment of the participants, and other similar information that might be missed during a normal dialogue and can be used to improve, analyze and act on conversations at scale. The Symbl.ai APIs help you extract conversation intelligence and make that data actionable by your organization.
